## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(lattice)
iono=read.csv("C:/Users/Surendhar/Desktop/ionosphere.csv",header=TRUE)
iono
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(iono$feature7,iono$feature32,col=c(1,2),main='feature 7 vs feature 32')
abline(lm(iono$feature32~iono$feature7))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
plot(iono$feature7,iono$feature33,col=c(1,2),main='feature 7 vs feature 32')
abline(lm(iono$feature33~iono$feature7))
```


```{r}
plot(iono$feature32,iono$feature33,col=c(1,2),main='feature 7 vs feature 32')
abline(lm(iono$feature33~iono$feature32))
```
